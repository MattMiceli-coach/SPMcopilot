## üöÄ Vision
Most organizations struggle with:
- ‚ùå Weak alignment of initiatives to strategy & OKRs  
- ‚ùå Manual, slow intake and funding decisions  
- ‚ùå Limited visibility into capacity & financial impact  

**SPMcopilot** addresses these pain points by:
- Mapping new initiatives to strategic themes & OKRs  
- Checking against portfolio capacity & funding blocks  
- Generating a decision-ready **one-pager** (Go / Defer / Split)  

This is the **MVP** for a larger platform of SPM AI agents, including quarterly planning, funding reconciliation, and executive dashboards.

- **OpenAI API** (LLM reasoning)
- **Streamlit** (demo UI)
- **Postgres + pgvector** (future memory store; mocked in MVP)
- **JSON files** for mock data (epics, strategy, capacity, funding)
